IPFees TO DO List

1. Admin page for allowed currencies -> Not all available currencies need to be shown to the client as target currencies, so we need an admin page in which individual currencies can be enabled/disabled.

2. Admin page for currency markup -> All currency conversions must have a markup (e.g. 1.5%) that gets added as a guard.

3. The calculation output should be a table with the following columns:

Jurisdiction | Language | Official fee | Agent fee | Service fee | Translation fee | Total fee per jurisdiction

Last line of the table should show the total fees for all selected countries.

— | — | Official fee sum | Agent fee sum| Service fee sum | Translation fee sum | Total fee per jurisdiction
