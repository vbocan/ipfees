Intellectual property (IP) fees for patents, trademarks, and designs vary across jurisdictions and are subject to frequent changes. To address this challenge, we introduce IPFLang, a domain-specific language for calculating IP fees that simplifies the process of determining the costs associated with protecting intellectual property in various countries. IPFLang allows users to specify the relevant IP laws and regulations for a particular jurisdiction and calculate the fees associated with a given patent, trademark, or design application. The language provides a comprehensive set of constructs for specifying different types of IP fees and their dependencies. The syntax of IPFLang is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a flexible structure that can be easily modified and extended. To evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of IPFLang, we present a case study that demonstrates its applicability in calculating the fees for a trademark application across multiple jurisdictions. Our results show that IPFLang significantly reduces the time and effort required to calculate IP fees and provides a useful tool for intellectual property practitioners and researchers. We believe that IPFLang has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of IP fee calculations and simplify the complex process of determining the costs of protecting intellectual property across multiple jurisdictions.
