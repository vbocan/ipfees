# IPFees - Intelligent Intellectual Property Fee Calculator

A revolutionary, jurisdiction-agnostic intellectual property fee calculation system that transforms complex legal fee structures into automated, accurate, and multi-currency calculations. This system addresses the significant challenge faced by intellectual property professionals who must navigate diverse fee structures across multiple jurisdictions while ensuring accurate cost calculations for clients.

## Key Features & Novel Approach

### Intelligent Fee Calculation Engine
The system implements a novel Domain-Specific Language (DSL) parser that allows complex fee structures to be defined in human-readable format rather than hardcoded business logic. This approach enables legal professionals to define and modify fee calculation rules without requiring software development expertise. The dynamic fee evaluation engine interprets these rules at runtime, supporting multi-layered calculations that include base fees, service fees, and complex conditional logic based on application parameters such as claim counts, page numbers, and filing types.

### Multi-Jurisdiction Architecture
The jurisdiction-agnostic design represents a revolutionary approach to handling international intellectual property fee calculations. Unlike traditional systems that hardcode jurisdiction-specific logic, this modular architecture allows new countries or regions to be added through configuration alone. Each jurisdiction defines its own fee rules through flexible configuration files, and independent fee modules can be combined and configured per jurisdiction, enabling unprecedented scalability and maintainability.

### Advanced Currency Management
The system provides sophisticated currency management through real-time integration with external exchange rate APIs, complemented by an intelligent three-tier fallback system. When online exchange rate services are unavailable, the system automatically transitions to backup CSV-based rates, ensuring continuous operation. The status-aware currency handling system provides clear user feedback about data freshness (Online, Stale, or Invalid) and supports automatic conversion between any of the 150+ supported currencies.

### Resilient Data Management
A hybrid data strategy combines MongoDB for persistent storage of jurisdiction data, fee structures, and calculation history with CSV backup files for critical exchange rate information. Background services automatically update exchange rates at configurable intervals, while graceful degradation ensures the system continues operating with backup data when external services fail. This approach guarantees high availability and data integrity.

### User-Centric Design
The web-based interface features a wizard-driven fee calculation process that guides users through jurisdiction selection, parameter specification, and result review. Real-time feedback provides instant validation and calculation updates as parameters change. The responsive design ensures optimal functionality across desktop and mobile devices, while transparent data status indicators keep users informed about the reliability of exchange rate data.

### Administrative Excellence
Runtime configuration capabilities allow fee structures to be modified without code deployment or system downtime. The administrative interface provides comprehensive module management for creating, editing, and organizing fee calculation modules. Centralized settings management handles currencies, API keys, and system parameters, while complete audit trails track all fee calculations and system changes for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

## Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docker.com) and Docker Compose
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ipfees
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables
cp src/.env.example src/.env

# Edit .env file with your settings:
# - MongoDB credentials
# - Exchange rate API key from https://www.exchangerate-api.com/
```

### 3. Start the Application
```bash
cd src
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Access the Application
- **Web Application**: http://localhost:8080
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8090/swagger
- **MongoDB**: localhost:27017

### 5. Initialize Sample Data (Optional)
```bash
# The application will create sample jurisdictions and modules on first run
# Or import your own data through the web interface
```

## Development Setup

### Local Development (without Docker)
```bash
# Prerequisites: .NET 8.0 SDK, MongoDB

# 1. Restore packages
dotnet restore

# 2. Configure MongoDB connection in appsettings.json
# 3. Start MongoDB locally or use cloud instance

# 4. Start the API
cd IPFees.API
dotnet run

# 5. Start the Web application
cd ../IPFees.Web
dotnet run
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test project
dotnet test IPFees.Core.Tests
dotnet test IPFees.Calculator.Tests
```

## Configuration

### Exchange Rate API Setup
1. Get a free API key from [exchangerate-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
2. Add to your `.env` file or `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "ExchangeRateApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
}
```

### MongoDB Configuration
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MongoDbConnection": "mongodb://username:password@host:port/database"
  }
}
```

### Backup Exchange Rates
Place backup CSV files in `IPFees.Web/wwwroot/data/` with format:
```csv
