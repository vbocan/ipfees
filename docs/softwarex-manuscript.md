## Abstract

IPFees is an open-source, jurisdiction-agnostic intellectual property fee calculation system that automates complex legal fee structures across 160+ global IP jurisdictions using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) approach. The platform addresses documented inefficiencies in IP fee management where professionals spend significant time on repetitive calculations across fragmented government-provided calculators. By enabling legal professionals to define and modify fee calculation rules without software development expertise, IPFees democratizes access to sophisticated fee computation while maintaining precision and auditability. Built on .NET 9.0 with MongoDB and Docker containerization, the system provides real-time currency conversion, multi-jurisdiction support, and comprehensive REST APIs for integration with existing IP management platforms. Independent validation by IP legal experts confirms dollar-accurate calculations across all implemented jurisdictions. The platform's DSL-based architecture demonstrates cross-domain applicability to other regulatory compliance systems requiring complex, jurisdiction-specific rule evaluation.

## 1. Motivation and Significance

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Intellectual property (IP) practitioners face a persistent challenge in accurately calculating filing, prosecution, and maintenance fees across diverse patent offices globally. Each jurisdiction implements unique fee structures with complex dependencies on entity size, claim counts, page numbers, filing types, and temporal factors. Current solutions present significant limitations:

**Fragmented Tools**: Government patent offices provide jurisdiction-specific calculators (e.g., USPTO fee schedule calculator, EPO fee calculator) that require manual navigation between multiple websites and separate calculations for each jurisdiction [1].

**Limited Commercial Solutions**: Existing IP management software platforms (e.g., CPA Global, Anaqua, PatSnap) primarily focus on docketing and portfolio management, with fee calculation either absent or limited to major jurisdictions. These platforms typically hardcode fee structures, requiring software updates for fee schedule changes [2].

**Manual Processes**: Many practitioners rely on spreadsheets and manual calculations, increasing error risk and consuming billable hours that could be allocated to higher-value legal analysis.

**Currency Complexity**: International IP portfolios require accurate multi-currency calculations with historical exchange rates for budget planning and invoicing, functionality rarely integrated into existing tools.

The absence of a unified, extensible, open-source solution creates inefficiencies in IP practice and limits research opportunities in computational law and regulatory automation.

### 1.2 Innovation and Contribution

IPFees introduces three primary innovations to IP fee management:

**DSL-Based Configuration**: Unlike hardcoded fee logic, IPFees implements a custom Domain-Specific Language [8] that allows jurisdiction-specific rules to be expressed in human-readable format. This approach separates business logic from software implementation, enabling IP professionals to define and modify fee structures without programming expertise. The DSL supports conditional logic, arithmetic operations, and jurisdiction-specific variables, providing sufficient expressiveness for complex regulatory frameworks while maintaining simplicity for common cases.

**Jurisdiction-Agnostic Architecture**: The platform's modular design treats each jurisdiction as a configuration entity rather than a code module. Adding support for new patent offices requires only JSON configuration files and DSL rule definitions, not software modifications. This architecture dramatically reduces the barrier to expanding jurisdiction coverage and enables community contributions.

**Computational Law Framework**: IPFees provides a reference implementation for encoding legal rules in executable format. The DSL approach ensures transparency, auditability, and version control for regulatory logic—properties essential for legal compliance systems [7]. The platform demonstrates how computational law principles can be applied to practical legal technology challenges.

### 1.3 Research and Practical Applications

**Legal Technology Research**: IPFees offers a testbed for studying automated compliance systems, rule-based AI in legal contexts, and human-computer interaction in specialized professional domains.

**DSL Development Best Practices**: The project demonstrates pragmatic DSL design for regulatory domains, balancing expressiveness with simplicity and maintainability.

**Multi-Currency Financial Systems**: The platform's three-tier exchange rate fallback mechanism (real-time API, historical database, manual override) provides a pattern for reliable financial calculations in distributed systems.

**Open Science in Legal Technology**: As an MIT-licensed open-source project, IPFees enables reproducible research in IP economics, fee structure analysis, and international patent system studies.

**Cross-Domain Applicability**: While developed for IP fees, the architecture extends naturally to other regulatory compliance domains including customs duties, tax calculations, and multi-jurisdiction licensing fees.

### 1.4 Related Work and Research Gap

DSL applications in legal domains have matured significantly, yet multi-jurisdiction fee calculation remains unexplored.

**Legal Contract DSLs**: Stipula [9] and Pacta Sunt Servanda [10] provide declarative syntax for contract obligations, temporal constraints, and formal verification. However, both focus on execution semantics rather than financial computations. Bartoletti et al. acknowledge: "monetary aspects require domain-specific treatment beyond generic contract languages" [10, p. 18].

**Regulatory Compliance**: LegalRuleML [14] offers XML-based legal rule specifications; REGOROUS [15] provides ontology-based compliance reasoning. Both emphasize binary compliance checking (compliant/non-compliant) with minimal arithmetic support. Catala [16], a DSL for tax law, demonstrates sophisticated financial calculations but targets single-jurisdiction applications and requires formal methods expertise.

**Existing Fee Calculators**: Patent offices (USPTO [1], EPO [4], JPO [11], WIPO [3]) provide web calculators with proprietary logic, lacking API access and multi-jurisdiction support. Commercial platforms (CPA Global, Anaqua) hardcode fee calculations in closed codebases requiring vendor patches for updates [2].

**Research Gap**: To the best of our knowledge, a systematic search of academic databases (ACM, IEEE, Springer, Web of Science) and GitHub reveals **a gap in DSL frameworks for multi-jurisdiction regulatory fee calculations with combined temporal logic, multi-currency support, and arithmetic expressiveness**. Open-source alternatives are limited to single-jurisdiction calculators (e.g., InPatent [5] for India only) with minimal functionality. Table 1 illustrates the positioning of IPFees in this underserved domain. Comprehensive literature review analyzing 50+ publications available in supplementary materials.

## 2. Software Description

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

IPFees implements a three-tier architecture optimized for extensibility and maintainability:

**Presentation Layer**: 
- **IPFees.Web**: ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application providing interactive user interface with Bootstrap 5 responsive design
- **IPFees.API**: RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for programmatic access and integration with IP management platforms

**Business Logic Layer**:
- **IPFees.Core**: Domain models, service interfaces, and business logic coordination
- **IPFees.Calculator**: Custom DSL parser and interpreter implementing fee calculation engine

**Data Layer**:
- **MongoDB**: Document database with GridFS for flexible jurisdiction schema and audit logging
- **Configuration System**: JSON-based jurisdiction definitions and fee structure specifications

The architecture follows SOLID principles with dependency injection, enabling independent testing and deployment of components. Docker containerization ensures reproducible deployments across development, testing, and production environments.

### 2.2 Domain-Specific Language: IPFLang

IPFees implements IPFLang (Intellectual Property Fees Language), a declarative DSL with explicit keyword-based syntax designed for legal professionals without programming expertise [8]. Unlike expression-based DSLs, IPFLang uses structured blocks with clear semantic keywords, following established DSL design guidelines emphasizing domain-specific notations, explicit semantics, and minimal syntax complexity [9].

**Input Definition**: IPFLang supports five input types with explicit declarations:

```
DEFINE LIST EntityType AS 'Select the desired entity type'
CHOICE NormalEntity AS 'Normal'
CHOICE SmallEntity AS 'Small'
CHOICE MicroEntity AS 'Micro'
DEFAULT NormalEntity
ENDDEFINE

DEFINE MULTILIST Countries AS 'Select validation countries'
CHOICE VAL_DE AS 'Germany'
CHOICE VAL_FR AS 'France'
CHOICE VAL_GB AS 'United Kingdom'
DEFAULT VAL_DE,VAL_FR
ENDDEFINE

DEFINE NUMBER SheetCount AS 'Enter the number of sheets'
BETWEEN 10 AND 1000
DEFAULT 15
ENDDEFINE

DEFINE BOOLEAN ContainsDependentClaims AS 'Does this contain dependent claims?'
DEFAULT TRUE
ENDDEFINE

DEFINE DATE ApplicationDate AS 'Application filing date'
BETWEEN 1990-01-01 AND 2025-12-31
DEFAULT 2024-01-01
ENDDEFINE
```

**Fee Computation**: Fee calculations use structured COMPUTE blocks with conditional logic:

```
COMPUTE FEE BasicNationalFee
YIELD 320 IF EntityType EQ NormalEntity
YIELD 128 IF EntityType EQ SmallEntity
YIELD 64 IF EntityType EQ MicroEntity
ENDCOMPUTE

COMPUTE FEE SearchFee
CASE SituationType EQ PreparedIPEA AS
YIELD 0 IF EntityType EQ NormalEntity
YIELD 0 IF EntityType EQ SmallEntity
YIELD 0 IF EntityType EQ MicroEntity
ENDCASE
YIELD 700 IF EntityType EQ NormalEntity
YIELD 280 IF EntityType EQ SmallEntity
YIELD 140 IF EntityType EQ MicroEntity
ENDCOMPUTE
```

**Supported Operations**:
- Comparison operators: `EQ`, `NEQ`, `GT`, `LT`, `GTE`, `LTE`
- Set membership: `IN`, `NIN` (for multi-selection inputs)
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `ROUND()`
- Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Date functions: `!MONTHSTONOW`, `!YEARSTONOW`, `!MONTHSTONOW_FROMLASTDAY`
- List operations: `!COUNT` (count of selected items)

**Variable Assignment**: Intermediate calculations use LET statements:

```
COMPUTE FEE ClaimFee
LET CF1 AS 265
LET CF2 AS 660
YIELD CF1*(ClaimCount-15) IF ClaimCount GT 15 AND ClaimCount LT 51
YIELD CF2*(ClaimCount-50) + CF1*35 IF ClaimCount GT 50
ENDCOMPUTE
```

The keyword-based syntax prioritizes readability and explicit semantics over conciseness, reducing the learning curve for legal professionals—a key principle of effective DSL design [9]. IPFLang implementation adheres to DSL design guidelines through: (1) **Domain-Specific Notation** using legal terminology (EntityType, ClaimFee, ValidationFee); (2) **Explicit Semantics** with clear keywords (DEFINE, COMPUTE, YIELD) avoiding ambiguous operators; (3) **Syntactic Sugar** minimizing boilerplate while maintaining clarity; and (4) **Error Prevention** through structured blocks with explicit ENDCOMPUTE and ENDDEFINE markers that aid comprehension and prevent common syntax errors. The language successfully balances expressiveness for complex regulatory rules with accessibility for non-programmer domain experts, demonstrating practical application of DSL engineering principles in the legal technology domain.

### 2.3 Multi-Currency System

IPFees implements a sophisticated three-tier currency conversion system:

1. **Real-Time API Provider**: Primary source for current exchange rates via configurable API integration
2. **Historical Database**: MongoDB-cached rates with automatic population from API calls, providing fallback for API unavailability
3. **Manual Override**: Administrator-configurable rates for jurisdictions requiring specific conversion factors or in case of extended API outages

The system maintains 6-8 decimal precision for high-value portfolio calculations and logs all conversions for audit trails. Exchange rates are timestamped and versioned, enabling historical fee calculations for budget planning and retrospective analysis.

### 2.4 Key Features

**Bulk Processing**: Portfolio-level fee estimation across multiple jurisdictions with CSV export for budget planning

**API-First Design**: Comprehensive REST endpoints enable integration with existing IP management systems, supporting automated fee calculations in docketing workflows

**Real-Time Validation**: Jurisdiction-specific validation rules prevent invalid parameter combinations (e.g., claims exceeding jurisdiction limits)

**Audit Logging**: Complete transaction history with jurisdiction, parameters, results, and exchange rates for compliance and reproducibility

**Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom currency providers and jurisdiction-specific calculation overrides

**Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface for on-the-go fee estimations and portfolio reviews

    {"type": "Number", "name": "ClaimCount", "value": 15}
  ],
  "targetCurrency": "USD"
}
```

**Portfolio Result** (with real-time currency conversion):
- UAE: AED 2,800 → $762 USD
- Indonesia: IDR 1,625,000 → $105 USD  
- Jamaica: JMD 34,500 → $221 USD
- **Total Portfolio Cost: $1,088 USD**

This demonstrates multi-currency capabilities and portfolio-level cost estimation across jurisdictions with different fee structures, enabling budget planning for international patent filings.

**Key Differentiators**: (1) **Open Source Transparency** – Many alternatives implement proprietary logic; IPFees' MIT-licensed DSL enables independent verification by legal professionals and auditors. (2) **API-First Architecture** – Government calculators provide no programmatic access; commercial platforms offer limited vendor-specific APIs [2]. IPFees provides comprehensive REST endpoints with OpenAPI documentation. (3) **DSL-Based Extensibility** – Commercial solutions hardcode fees requiring vendor patches; IPFees enables immediate DSL updates without software deployment. (4) **Multi-Currency Precision** – Three-tier fallback mechanism (real-time API, historical database, manual override) with 6-8 decimal precision ensures reliable calculations during API outages.

GitHub search reveals limited open-source alternatives: InPatent [5] supports only India (0 stars, inactive since 2022); ipr-management [6] focuses on rights management. No multi-jurisdiction DSL-based calculator exists. Detailed 50+ dimension comparison in supplementary materials (docs/comparison-table.md).

### 4.2 Validation and Accuracy

Independent validation by IP legal experts at Jet IP (https://www.jet-ip.legal) confirmed dollar-accurate calculations across all implemented jurisdictions. The validation process involved:

1. Comparison with official patent office fee schedules for 20+ major jurisdictions
2. Cross-verification against commercial IP management platform calculations
3. Edge case testing including maximum claim counts, unusual entity sizes, and deadline-sensitive fees
4. Currency conversion accuracy testing against Bloomberg exchange rate data

The DSL approach provides inherent advantages for validation: rules can be reviewed by legal professionals without reading software code, and version control enables tracking changes to fee structures over time.

### 4.3 Performance Characteristics

Benchmark testing on reference hardware (32GB RAM, 8 vCPU, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) demonstrates production-ready performance:

- Single calculation: <100ms (simple), <500ms (complex multi-component)
- Bulk calculations: 50-100 jurisdictions in <2 seconds
- Concurrent users: 50+ simultaneous without degradation
- Currency conversion: <200ms (real-time API), <10ms (cached rates)
- API response P95: <300ms including database and currency conversion

MongoDB document database provides sub-millisecond query performance for jurisdiction configurations, enabling responsive user experience for complex portfolio calculations.

---

## 5. Reusability and Extensibility

### 5.1 Cross-Domain Applications

While developed for IP fee management, the IPFees architecture demonstrates applicability to other regulatory compliance domains:

**International Tax Calculations**: Corporate tax obligations across jurisdictions involve complex rules, entity-specific rates, and temporal factors—structural similarities to IP fee calculations. The DSL could encode tax code logic with jurisdiction-specific deductions and credits.

**Customs and Import Duties**: Harmonized System (HS) codes determine import duties based on product classification, country of origin, and trade agreements. The DSL's conditional logic naturally expresses these rule-based calculations.

**Multi-Jurisdiction Licensing Fees**: Professional licenses (medical, engineering, legal) require renewal fees varying by jurisdiction, credential type, and practitioner status. The platform's architecture supports these scenarios with minimal modification.

**Regulatory Compliance Reporting**: Industries requiring multi-jurisdiction compliance (financial services, pharmaceuticals, environmental) could leverage the DSL to encode reporting requirements and fee structures.

The key insight is that many regulatory domains share structural properties: jurisdiction-specific rules, conditional logic based on entity characteristics, temporal factors, and financial calculations. IPFees provides a tested framework for encoding and executing such rules reliably.

### 5.2 Extension Mechanisms

IPFees provides multiple extension points for customization:

**Custom Currency Providers**: Implement `ICurrencyProvider` interface to integrate with enterprise exchange rate services, cryptocurrency APIs, or blockchain-based rate oracles.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Calculators**: Extend `BaseFeeCalculator` for jurisdictions requiring procedural logic beyond DSL expressiveness (rare but supported).

**Custom DSL Functions**: Add domain-specific functions to the DSL interpreter (e.g., date calculations for deadline-based fees).

**Audit and Compliance Modules**: Integrate with enterprise compliance systems via webhook notifications and event streams.

**Report Generators**: Extend the reporting engine for jurisdiction-specific filing documents and fee payment receipts.

### 5.3 Community Contribution Model

The MIT license and GitHub-hosted repository enable open collaboration:

- Jurisdiction definitions (JSON + DSL) can be contributed via pull requests without code modifications
- Community members can add support for new patent offices, updating the platform's coverage
- Translation files enable localization for non-English speaking jurisdictions
- Test cases ensure submitted jurisdiction rules meet accuracy standards

This contribution model democratizes IP fee calculation by distributing the maintenance burden across the global IP community rather than centralizing it with a single vendor.

## 6. Limitations and Future Development

### 6.1 Current Limitations

**DSL Expressiveness**: Simple syntax limits highly complex procedural structures. While 160+ jurisdictions encode successfully, edge cases may require custom implementations, prioritizing accessibility over complete expressiveness.

**Scope of Features**: Focus on fee calculation excludes advanced NLP, complex temporal reasoning, or external database integration, maintaining simplicity and minimal learning curve.

**Currency Provider Dependencies**: Real-time conversion requires external APIs. Three-tier fallback mitigates outages, but extended unavailability needs manual intervention.

### 6.2 Planned Enhancements

**LLM-Assisted DSL Generation**: Large Language Models will analyze WIPO fee schedules to automatically generate draft DSL code, addressing the primary barrier to jurisdiction expansion. Human-in-the-loop workflow ensures deterministic, auditable calculations while leveraging LLM encoding capabilities.

**Enhanced Reporting**: PDF generation for filings, invoice integration, portfolio analytics dashboards.

**API Expansion**: GraphQL endpoints, webhooks for events, batch processing for large-scale analysis.

**Research Applications**: Historical fee analysis for cost prediction, anomaly detection, optimal filing strategy recommendations.

### 6.3 Research Directions

**Computational Law Studies**: IPFees provides infrastructure for empirical studies of fee structure complexity, cross-jurisdiction comparative analysis, and economic modeling of patent system accessibility.

**DSL Evolution**: Research opportunities include formal verification of DSL rules, automated testing generation from natural language specifications, and optimization of DSL interpreter performance.

**Legal Technology Adoption**: User studies examining how legal professionals interact with DSL-based configuration, adoption barriers in conservative legal environments, and training methodologies for non-technical users.

---

## 7. Conclusions

IPFees suggests that Domain-Specific Languages provide a viable approach to encoding complex regulatory logic in legal technology systems. By separating jurisdiction-specific rules from software implementation, the platform enables legal professionals to maintain and extend fee calculation capabilities without programming expertise. Independent validation confirms production-ready accuracy, while performance benchmarks demonstrate suitability for enterprise-scale deployment.

The open-source nature of IPFees aims to address a documented gap in IP practice tools, providing both individual practitioners and research institutions with access to sophisticated fee calculation capabilities. The architecture's cross-domain applicability suggests broader applications in computational law and regulatory automation.

As patent systems worldwide continue to evolve their fee structures in response to policy objectives and technological change, tools that enable rapid adaptation without software redevelopment could become increasingly valuable. The project invites contributions from the global IP community to expand jurisdiction coverage and enhance capabilities, democratizing access to sophisticated IP fee management.
